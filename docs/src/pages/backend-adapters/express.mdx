# Getting started with Express

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the package

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    npm install uploadthing
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn add uploadthing
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm install uploadthing
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

### Add env variables

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy filename="src/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing } from "uploadthing/express";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/express";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  videoAndImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
    video: {
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(() => ({}))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => {
      console.log("upload completed", data);
    }),

  withMdwr: f({
    image: {
      maxFileCount: 2,
      maxFileSize: "1MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware((opts) => {
      const h = opts.req.headers["someProperty"];

      if (!h) throw new Error("someProperty is required");

      return {
        someProperty: h,
        otherProperty: "hello" as const,
      };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ metadata, file }) => {
      console.log("uploaded with the following metadata:", metadata);
      console.log("files successfully uploaded:", file);
    }),

  withoutMdwr: f({
    image: {
      maxFileCount: 2,
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(() => {
      return { testMetadata: "lol" };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ metadata, file }) => {
      console.log("uploaded with the following metadata:", metadata);
      console.log("files successfully uploaded:", file);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: You need to serve this API from `/api/uploadthing` on your application.
  In addition, you have to have `json` middleware to be set up
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
import { createExpressRouter } from "uploadthing/express";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing";

app.use(express.json());

app.use(
  "/api/uploadthing",
  createExpressRouter({
    router: uploadRouter,
  }),
);
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

Assuming you use React on the client

```tsx copy filename="src/component.tsx"
import type { OurFileRouter } from "./uploadthing";

export default function Component() {
  return (
    <UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
      endpoint="imageUploader"
      onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
        // Do something with the response
        console.log("Files: ", res);
        alert("Upload Completed");
      }}
      onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
        // Do something with the error.
        alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

</Steps>
